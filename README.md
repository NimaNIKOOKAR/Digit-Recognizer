# 📊 Digit Recognizer Competition

This project tackles the classic **MNIST handwritten digit classification** problem, a foundational computer vision task that has become the “Hello World” of machine learning. It’s hosted on [Kaggle’s Digit Recognizer Competition](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/digit-recognizer), which provides a safe sandbox to test out your computer vision and machine learning skills, regardless of whether you’re just getting started or brushing up on your fundamentals.

## 🚀 Competition Overview

- **Dataset:** Images of handwritten digits (0-9) from the MNIST dataset.
- **Goal:** Predict the correct digit label for each image in the test set.
- **Evaluation Metric:** Classification accuracy — straightforward and brutally honest. Your model either gets it right or it doesn’t.

## ⚡️ Why This Competition?

Let’s be real — MNIST isn’t exactly cutting-edge these days. But it’s still invaluable for:

✅ Practicing computer vision workflows.  
✅ Comparing classical algorithms (SVM, k-NN) to more modern deep learning models.  
✅ Experimenting in a risk-free environment — no prizes here, so no stress.

This competition uses **pre-extracted features** and offers **beginner-friendly tutorials** in Python (e.g., Keras-based MLPs) and R (random forests, basic neural nets). If you’re itching to go deeper, Kaggle Learn has solid mini-courses to get you up to speed.

## 🧰 Project Resources & Tutorials

- **Deep Neural Network in Keras:**  
  Covers feature standardization, one-hot encoding, and model implementation.

- **Dimensionality Reduction:**  
  Includes PCA, LDA, t-SNE with interactive Plotly visualizations.

- **Random Forest Benchmark (R)**  
- **Minimum Distance Classifier (R)**  
- **Build a Neural Network from Scratch (R)**  

## 📈 Leaderboard Nuances

Let’s cut to the chase:  
✔️ The test set labels are public, so perfect scores aren’t exactly a mystery.  
✔️ No prize, no medals, no problem. It’s purely for learning and experimentation.

Also worth noting:  
- **Submissions > 2 months old?** They’re invalidated to keep things fresh.  
- **Rolling leaderboard updates** every two months to prevent clutter from abandoned scores.

## 🧑‍💻 Teaming Up

Even in a beginner’s competition, collaboration pays off. You can:  
- Form or merge teams.  
- Update your team’s details.  
- Tap into the community — ask for partners in the discussion forum.
